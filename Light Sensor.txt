Let there be 4 Parents: A, B, C, and D

A - 1, 2, 3, 4
B - 5, 6
C - 7, 8       
D - 9, 10

Let ON be the trigger of light sensor
let OFF be the untrigger of the light sensor

//Basic Block

if A == ON and B == ON:
	you are at top left corner
	you can't move left and up anymore
	you need to move down and right
elif A == ON and C == ON:
	you are at top right corner
	you can't move right and up anymore
	you need to move down and left
elif D == ON and B == ON:
	you are at bottom left corner
	you can't move left and up anymore
	you need to move up and right
elif D == ON and C == ON:
	you are at bottom right corner
	you can't move right and down anymore
	you need to move up and left

elif A == ON:
	You are at top
	you can't move up
	you need to move down
elif B == ON:
	You are at left
	you can't move left
	you need to move right
elif C == ON:
	You are at right
	you can't move right
	you need to move left
elif D == ON:
	You are at down
	you can't move down
	you need to move up
	
let there be 2 Parents: OUTER and INNER

OUTER - 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10
INNER - 3, 4, 6, 8

//Emergency Block

INNER is a lot more important than OUTER, if INNER is ON, the robot should take immediate actions.
On the other side, if only OUTER is ON, the robot may continue moving but the area of A,B,C or D will be abandoned.

//Expectations Block

Technically, area A and D will not be ON at the same time, nor the same with area B and C.
However, if it does happen, these 2 areas should be abandoned and only move into the other two directions until the unexpected case is solved.

If everything is on,
spin wildly in a random circle trying to kill any other robots
which are near it (especially enemy robots)
